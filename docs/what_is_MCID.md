MCID (Mento Carlo ID) is a unique identifier assigned to particles in high-energy physics simulations. It is widely used in Monte Carlo event generators and particle physics software to represent different types of particles, including their properties and interactions.


The MCID system is based on the Particle Data Group (PDG) numbering scheme, which assigns a unique integer to each particle type. The MCID extends this scheme to include additional particles and resonances that may not be covered by the PDG (such as for BESIII experiment).
